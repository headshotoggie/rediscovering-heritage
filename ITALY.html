      <li><h3>Reggia di Caserta </h3>
        <br>
        <p> The Reggia di Caserta is a former royal residence located outside Naples. It’s one of the world’s largest palaces and was built in the 18th century for Charles VII, the Bourbon King of Naples. The Baroque and Neoclassical complex was inspired by the Palace of Versailles and boasts 1,200 rooms across five floors, adorned with elaborate frescoes, gilded decorations and sweeping marble floors. The palace itself is situated in 120 hectares of beautifully-landscaped parkland that features a number of fountains, pools and ornamental statues.</p>

      <li><h3> Castel del Monte</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Castel del Monte is certainly not the only castle on Italy’s UNESCO list, but it is the only perfectly octagonal one. Built in the 1240s by Frederick II, the enigmatic fortress was designed with such mathematical and astronomical precision that UNESCO describes it as a ‘unique piece of medieval military architecture’. Lacking traditional features such as a moat or drawbridge, the castle has puzzled historians as to its purpose, with some suggesting it was an elaborate hunting lodge.</p>

      <li><h3>Modena Cathedral</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Modena’s impressive 12th-century cathedral is a prime example of early Romanesque art. Unusually for this time period, we know the name (though little else) of the architect, Lanfranco, who was celebrated in his time. The façade features reliefs by Wiligelmo, another artist who we know little about, but whose sculptures on both the interior and exterior walls are revered by scholars. The site also includes the cathedral’s annexed bell tower, the Ghirlandina, and the accompanying Piazza Grande.</p>
