            <h2>What is Cultural Heritage?</h2>

              The word ‘culture’ is sometimes used to refer to the highest intellectual endeavours and the pursuit of perfection and beauty. As the poet and critic Matthew Arnold put it, culture is 'the best that has been thought and known in the world'. We now more commonly think of culture as being about beliefs, customs, language and arts of a particular society, group, place, or time and the symbols and expression of shared values, traditions and customs.

                  What happens when we search tourist destinations of a particular country/place , numerous of famous places come up as an option 
                  However , certain sites , irrespective of their  cultural  importance are often overlooked.
                  Moreover , as these places usually  have a lot less tourists , Government and Authorities pay no or near to no heed to these sites.
                  Resulting  in depletion and demolition of such places over the time.
                  So it becomes the responsibility of ours to preserve them and  explore the cultural diversity.

                            With sites at risk, there is much more that can be done, for example through the virtual mapping of sites, so that they are preserved digitally, as well as working on the relationship between populations and their cultural heritage.

                            We need to give equal weight to preserving the intangible heritage. This is not least because there is often much more that can be done in that area, even while the conflict is raging. We have a partnership to that effect with Action For Hope, an organisation that works with Syrian refugees in Jordan. Initially a project that provided comfort to refugee families by helping them cook familiar, evocative and culturally important dishes, it has now expanded and become an important part of building resilience among them. Archives of photos, film footage, stories, poems and oral histories help those who normally see themselves as victims maintain their cultural identity and pride.0
